# ARINC 429 Transmitter Using Arduino (AVR-C Implementation)

This project demonstrates how to build a **basic ARINC 429 transmitter** using an Arduino that generates a **SPI-like signal**.  
The transmitted waveform has correct rise and fall times and can drive an **ARINC 429 differential bus** through a simple hardware chain.

---

## üß© Overview

The transmission logic is implemented entirely in **pure AVR-C**, without relying on the Arduino framework.  
However, the program can be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino toolchain.

The signal chain is:

Arduino (USART in SPI mode)  
‚Üì  
74HC00 NAND network  
‚Üì   
HI-8586 line driver (Holt)   
‚Üì   
ARINC 429 differential bus (A,B)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Timing Control

ARINC 429 defines two standard data rates:
- **High-speed:** 100 kHz  
- **Low-speed:** 12.5 kHz  

The standard Arduino **SPI peripheral** can easily generate the **100 kHz** rate,  
but it cannot reach **12.5 kHz** because the 16 MHz system clock cannot be divided finely enough.

To solve this, the project uses the **USART in Synchronous (SPI) mode**, also known as **MSPIM**.  
In this configuration, the USART‚Äôs baud-rate generator acts as a flexible clock divider,  
allowing precise frequency control for both ARINC data rates.

The rising and falling times are managed by the HI-8586 SLP1.5 input pin. The HIGH or LOW states change the    
rising and falling times. In the `main.c` file the SLP1.5 is connected to PD5, and managed    
inside the `usart0_mspim_init` function.

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Arduino Nano** | Main controller (ATmega328P @ 16 MHz) |
| **74HC00** | Generates complementary signals for differential input |
| **Holt HI-8586** | ARINC 429 line driver |
| **1 nF capacitor (optional)** | Low-pass filtering or edge-shaping across differential lines |

## ‚ö° USART Clock Pin (XCK)

The **XCKn** pin outputs the synchronous clock used by the MSPIM mode.  
Not all Arduino boards expose this pin:

| Board | XCK Pin | Available? |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Arduino Uno** | D8 (PB0) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Arduino Nano** | D8 (PB0) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Arduino Micro** | D9 (PD5) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Arduino Mega 2560** | PE2 / PD5 / PH2 / PJ2 | ‚ùå Not routed to headers |

## üß† Software Notes

- Written in **pure AVR-C** for maximum control over timing and registers.
- Uses the **USART in MSPIM mode** (`UMSELn1:0 = 11`) to generate a synchronous clock.
- Baud-rate generator (`UBRRn`) determines the ARINC bit rate:
  - `UBRR = 639` ‚Üí 12.5 kHz
  - `UBRR = 79`  ‚Üí 100 kHz
- The transmitted data follows ARINC 429 word structure with correct bit ordering.

## üß™ Usage

1. Connect your Arduino Nano to the 74HC00 and HI-8586 as shown in the schematic found in the Le Labo de Michel YouTube Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smht2AQNsMY (min 13:47). 
2. For the HI-8586 dual rail power supply (-5V, +5V) a cheap small Aliexpress dual rail board will do the job just fine.  
3. In the `main.c` choose the transmission speed by changing the function `usart0_mspim_init(UBRR)`:
   - **Low speed (12.5 kHz):** set `UBRR = 639`
   - **High speed (100 kHz):** set `UBRR = 79`
4. In the `main.c` adjust the ARINC message using the `arinc429_send` function.
5. Observe the ARINC 429 signal on the HI-8586 output differential lines A, B.
